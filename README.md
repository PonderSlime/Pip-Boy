# Pip-Boy
Fully-functional recreation of the pip boy from the Fallout franchise. This has features including:
- Pulse oximeter for heart rate
- GPS for location tracking
- RTL-SDR for hacking the radio waves

I decided to build this project because I had recently came across Fallout 4, which quickly rose to my top 5 video games list. When Highway was annouced, I decided I should build something from it. I had two options: build power armor (which would cost way too much, and is already being done by Hacksmith Industries), or the Pip-Boy (which is much more achievable for several reasons, cost included). Of course I chose the Pip-Boy, because It is still a really cool piece of tech. Another reason to build this was because I thought it would be really cool to navigate an entire system with just knobs, and one button.
