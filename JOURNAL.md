# May 22nd-23rd: Started on Modeling the housing!

Did a bit of research on the size of the Pip Boy is, and started modeling it in Onshape.
I figured out how to use some tools I haven't used before, including the wrap tool and split tool. The base shape of the Pip-Boy is somewhat complete, but I still have a long way to go until I am done with the polished design (still need to add a ton of details, knobs, screw holes, vents, and many other things.)

**Total time spent: 3h**


# May 23rd-24th: Added some knobs!
I started to model where each of the knobs will go on the Pip-Boy. Also, I fixed some of the form factor of the overall arm section. I didn't really do a ton though

**Total time spent: 2h**


# May 26th: Continuing knobby things
I added a knob for secondary menu selection and radio tuning, as well as a select button and a radio tuner indicator spot

# May 27th: Finished knobby stuff
I added both of the navigation wheels, as well as split apart the tube and electronics housing sections.

**Total time spent: 1h**


# May 28th: Started Latch Mechanism, Arm Erginomics
I started work on the latch mecanism for the Pip-Boy, and also turned the cylendrical interior of the model into more of a cone shape.
