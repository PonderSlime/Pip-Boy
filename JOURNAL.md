# May 22nd-23rd: Started on Modeling the housing!

Did a bit of research on the size of the Pip Boy is, and started modeling it in Onshape.
I figured out how to use some tools I haven't used before, including the wrap tool and split tool. The base shape of the Pip-Boy is somewhat complete, but I still have a long way to go until I am done with the polished design (still need to add a ton of details, knobs, screw holes, vents, and many other things.)
