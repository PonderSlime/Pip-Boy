# May 22nd-23rd: Started on Modeling the housing!

Did a bit of research on the size of the Pip Boy is, and started modeling it in Onshape.
I figured out how to use some tools I haven't used before, including the wrap tool and split tool. The base shape of the Pip-Boy is somewhat complete, but I still have a long way to go until I am done with the polished design (still need to add a ton of details, knobs, screw holes, vents, and many other things.)

**Time spent: 3h**


# May 23rd-24th: Added some knobs!
I started to model where each of the knobs will go on the Pip-Boy. Also, I fixed some of the form factor of the overall arm section. I didn't really do a ton though

**Time spent: 2h**


# May 26th: Continuing knobby things
I added a knob for secondary menu selection and radio tuning, as well as a select button and a radio tuner indicator spot

# May 27th: Finished knobby stuff
I added both of the navigation wheels, as well as split apart the tube and electronics housing sections.

**Time spent: 1h**


# May 28th: Started Latch Mechanism, Arm Erginomics
I started work on the latch mecanism for the Pip-Boy, and also turned the cylendrical interior of the model into more of a cone shape.

# June 27th: Back From Break, Finished Latch Mechanism & Hinges, Added Encoder and Heatset Mounting Holes
I finally got the motivation to continue working on my project. I finished uo the latch mechanism and the upper hinge with some 3mm rods. Also, I added spots for the encoders on all of the knobs. In addition, I added a handful of heatset holes that are hidden from the frontside to secure it together.

# June 28th: Added Texture to the Knobs, did Research on RTL-SDR Modules
I added some nice details to each of the knobs, and gave them cool grips. Also, I fixed the latch tolerances so they actually work, and did some research on how I could get FM radio recieving on my device.

# June 29th: Started Work on a BOM, Added Latch Pin Slot, Manufacturing Research
Today I decided to start working on a bill of materials for my project. I also took some time to figure out where/how I should get the case manufactured. After trying several CNC companies' auto quote, I determined that it would be way too expensive ($30.00 USD for just one simple latch part!). Instead, I will 3D print the parts and electroplate it at home. The only change I made to the CAD model today was adding a latch pin slot so that the latch can actually lock properly.
